## Front end Developer
A front end developer works on "front end" code in an application, commonly meaning the code that customers and product users interact with directly. A "front end dev" will typically write CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to build complex interfaces for people to use. The front end development stack is always changing but tends to involve a front end library like Angular, React, Vue or Web components and a lot of backend knowledge in "tooling" like yarn / npm.

## IDE
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. This software is used to debug, compile, and run the code. It is a software that can build applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface. IDE’s can support one or multiple languages of code. IDLE is an IDE that only supports python code. Visual studios, once downloaded the correct language, can support multiple languages.

## Angular

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a popular TypeScript framework that is used to create web applications. It started out being used to make single paged applications but after the rapid growth in popularity of other JS frameworks such as React.js, it received many additional features to make it better suited for a variety of different application types. One of the things that Angular users particularly like is that Angular is based in TypeScript. A common criticism of JavaScript is the lack of type restrictions. In JavaScript a variable could be any type and a function could return any type but in TypeScript, these types must be predefined which helps provide clarity and assurance that the return data type of a function will always be the one desired.

Another thing about angular that makes it appealing is that it is backed by Google which helps developers be more confident that Angular will be maintained for longer and receive more support throughout its lifetime. Angular is also an extremely popular framework and with popularity comes lots of contributions from other developers. Angular has thousands of different components that developers made and share which makes it very easy to get complex web components running on your own page just by bringing in the one the other developer made.

## React


## Vue.js

Vue.js (pronounced the same as ‘view’) is a progressive Javascript framework used for developing user interfaces. Designed to be adoptable, Vue's basics are relatively easy to understand and can easily be integrated into existing projects and libraries. Vue enables developers to extend HTML and HTML attributes with directives, special tokens in markup that indicate how the library should handle certain Document Object Model (DOM) elements. Directives can be built-in or user defined.

Vue is similar to React in purpose, but each have different pros and cons. Ease of integration is a common praise for Vue and a less strict learning curve is also a relevant bonus. Vue was created by one man named Evan You and has always been open-source, relying heavily on community support. He created Vue to combine features from already popular frameworks like React and Angular.

## Accessibility / A11y

A general definition of accessibility, or “A11y”, is a product or service that is obtainable easily. The term “A11y” was coined by The A11y Project to promote accessibility across websites. As technology expands, accessibility is very important because users need to have convenient access to things like websites, apps, etc. 

Another function of accessibility is the focus on treating people equally. Accessibility accommodates people with disabilities to have the same experience as everyone else. As a result, accessibility improves usability, avoids discrimination and legal complications, builds positive public relations, and creates a better search engine optimization (SEO).
